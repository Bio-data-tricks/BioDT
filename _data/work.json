    "description_long": "The NYC Crash Mapper Chart View is a data exploration tool that allows users to filter, compare, rank, and view trends in vehicle collision data reported by the NYPD. Trend allows you to compare two selected areas’ performance against each other and to a citywide or borough-wide reference, while filtering by date range or type of crash. Compare lets you compare two time periods for a given area. Rank shows where one area ranks in terms of safety in the context of all similar areas over the most recent three-year period. Map will show the geo location of the crashes using the first area selected, date range of period A, and crash type filters. This was phase two of the original NYC Crash Mapper project. NYC Crash Mapper began as a personal project of mine, then was further developed to include interactive chart components during my tenure at [GreenInfo Network](http://greeninfo.org). NYC Crash Mapper was featured on the infamous [NYC Streets Blog](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/03/08/map-the-dangerous-streets-in-your-neighborhood-with-this-new-tool/). I gave a talk about the app and the challenges of using open data at the [NACIS 2017 annual conference](http://localhost:4000/about/talks/).",

    "description_long": "NYC Crash Mapper is a web application that dynamically maps, analyzes, and filters vehicle collision data reported by the NYPD in New York City from 2011 to present. The web app allows a user to select a date range for when crashes occurred, filter the data by crash type (injury or fatality; pedestrian, cyclist, or motorist), filter by administrative boundary, or filter by a custom area using a draw tool. Specific “views” of the data can be shared with other users via a stateful URL which contains any applied filters and map zoom and center. Data from the app may be downloaded in various formats such as CSV, Shapefile, and GeoJSON. New collision data is updated to the app’s database weekly using an ETL script running on a Heroku Scheduler. [Chekpeds](http://chekpeds.com), a non-profit that advocates for pedestrian safety in Hell’s Kitchen, funded the work on the app through a grant from New York City. In addition to developing the app, I designed the user interface using Adobe Illustrator.

It is an attempt at using open data as a prompt for civic action, rather than solely for visualization and analysis. The app asks the user to input their address and checks it against a database of properties that are likely to have rent stabilized apartments. From here the app recommends a course of action and informs the user of their nearest tenants rights group so they can get help. The app features a responsive interface that is mobile friendly, and its content can be toggled to either Spanish or Chinese for non-english speakers.",
